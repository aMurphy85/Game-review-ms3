# User Experience

## Project goals
The goal of game review is for people that are passionate about gaming to find what games are popular through registered users reviews. Visitors to the site can scan through other gamers reviews, get direct links to sites where they can view videos on game play and directly to a shop where they can purchase the game for themselves.

### New user's to this site:

* As a user, I want to be able to leave reviews on games for others to see
* As a user, I want to find new games to play
* As a user, I want good information on games

* As a user, I want links to further information and video gameplay of games I am interested in
* As a user, I want links to sites where they can purchase games

### Returning user's to this site:

* As a user, I want to be able to delete any reviews I have made before

### Site goals:
* As a site owner, I want to build a friendly community where gamers can continue to share their opinions on games they like or dislike, share tips and tricks that could help others and posiibly even make new friends.

# Design

## Wirefrmaes

While working on the project some adjustments were made that improved the website:

* Landing page image: I decided to use a slider function from materialize to showcase numerous gameplay images
* Games page: Decided to add a search function so user's can enter the title of the game they are looking for
* Games page: Didn't manage to implement a sub catergory layout style in time so all games are under a generic title of games
* Footer: All contents in the footer are center aligned for a simple look, better UX and flow
